Connected Business

When we hear about the Internet of Things, the context in which it is mentioned is often related to the smart home or other consumer electronic applications, but what if we told you that much of the early traction in IoT is in the connected business or commercialization of IoT in connected buildings? Gartner, a leading market research and advisory firm, has recently released research showing that the adoption of IoT in commercial buildings will “eclipse” that of the smart home until 2017. Legacy building automation (BAS) and management systems (BMS) have been around for years, but for the first time, property managers now have the ability to access their systems from a central location as IoT bridges the gap of these traditionally siloed systems. IoT is allowing for the optimization and improved efficiency of HVAC, lighting, fire & life safety, and security & access controls, not only saving money and reducing the time to market, but improving the health and comfort of the occupants.

Benefits for OEMs

OEMs servicing the connected business have traditionally been left on the outside looking in. However, IoT is enabling OEMs of connected business products access to data that has never been available, allowing them to build better products that are highly flexible and much more efficient.



Access to data that was normally siloed and available only to property managers



Ability to provide user-centric and other premium services to increase device efficiency and or occupant health & comfort



Flexibility to architect a solution that is system and device agnostic



Greatly reduce installation and ongoing maintenance costs
