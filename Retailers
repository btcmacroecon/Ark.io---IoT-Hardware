Retailers and Service Providers
The Internet of things represents a huge opportunity for retailers and service providers to take advantage of the emerging market for the connected home. It provides them a great opportunity to recapture their market value by adding value to their customers. In addition to being an explosive growth market, the IoT plays well to the retailers and service providersâ€™ strengths such as wide geographic coverage, expertise in offering monthly services and extensive networks of channel and technology partners that can help them meet this large challenge with innovation.

While providing IoT connected devices and services represents tremendous revenue opportunity, delivering the core device connectivity in a scalable and secure manner across multiple devices is not a core strength for most retailers and service providers.

Ayla provides retailers and service providers with a complete cloud platform to enable end-to-end IoT solutions.

Benefits For Retailers
Retailers and service providers, with their pre-existing relationship with the consumer, have a great opportunity to win the battle of the platforms. The IoT enables the flexibility and increased feature sets needed to not only win, but to remain a leader in an ever-changing market.
